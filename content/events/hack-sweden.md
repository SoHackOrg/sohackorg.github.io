Hack Sweden is a one-time hackathon on the theme "public good software". We want to encourage people to build stuff that can help inhabitants of Sweden, especially if you take advantage of the numerous public APIs available from government agencies.

The goals are:
* Build something for public good and/or take advantage of public government APIs.
* Have fun and be social.
