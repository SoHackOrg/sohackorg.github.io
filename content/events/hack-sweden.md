Hack Sweden is a one-time hackathon on the theme "public good software". We want to encourage people to build stuff that can help inhabitants of Sweden. The primary focus will be taking advantage of open data and APIs made available by government agencies.

The goals are:
* Build something for public good that takes advantage of public government APIs and open data.
* Have fun and be social.
